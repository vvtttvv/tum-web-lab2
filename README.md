# Laboratory 2

## About the lab:
 Course: Web programming 
 Implementedd by: Titerez Vladislav
 Checked by: Pr. Străinu

## Topic
My family and relatives do not own any business, so I decided to create a landing page for my friend’s parents’ flower shop in Balti. They have an Instagram account, which I used as a reference. From there, I took the photos and the information.

## Screenshots
So, according to the requirements I created five sections for my laning page:

### Home Section
This section serves as the first visual contact with the user. It contains a short slogan, a brief description of the flower shop, and a clear call-to-action button that encourages visitors to place an order or get in touch.

### About Section
The About section provides a short overview of LUNA's Flowers, presenting the shop's background, values, and main activity. Its goal is to build trust and give visitors a better understanding of the brand and its mission.

### Products Section
This section showcases the main flower collections offered by the shop. It includes a grid layout with product cards, each displaying an image, a name, and a short description. The section is designed to visually engage users and help them explore the available floral arrangements.
